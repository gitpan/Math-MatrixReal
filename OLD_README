# Old Installation Instructions (should still work):

## Preliminary steps for use with Perl prior to version 5.002:

Edit the "Makefile.PL" file in this package and change the line

    'VERSION_FROM'	=> 'MatrixReal.pm',

to

    'VERSION'		=> '2.04',


## How to install it:

Please unpack and build this package OUTSIDE the Perl source and distribution
tree!!

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("Math-MatrixReal-1.3/").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL".
    (Or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5 binary is)
    Alternatively you can type, e.g., "perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/doe"
    to install the module in the home directory, e.g. John Doe...

 3) Type "make".

 3.5) Optionally, type "make test" to test the build and/or benchmark
    your system a little.

 4) Type "make install".
