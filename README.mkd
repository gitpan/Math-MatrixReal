# Math::MatrixReal

Report bugs and submit patches at http://github.com/leto/math--matrixreal

## Requirements:

Perl version 5.003 or higher capable of "overloading" (overload.pm).

## What does it do:

### Math::MatrixReal - Matrix of Reals

Implements the data type "matrix of reals" (and consequently also
"vector of reals") which can be used almost like any other basic
Perl type thanks to OPERATOR OVERLOADING, i.e.,

    $A       = $matrix1 * $matrix2;
    $B       = $A ** 2;
    $C       = $A + 2*B;
    $D       = $C - $B/2;
    $inverse = $C ** -1;
    $inverse = 1/$C;

does what you would like it to do.

Also features many important operations and methods: matrix norm,
matrix transposition, matrix inverse, determinant of a matrix, order
and numerical condition of a matrix, scalar product of vectors, vector
product of vectors, vector length, projection of row and column vectors,
a comfortable way for reading in a matrix from a file, the keyboard or
your code, and many more.

Allows to solve linear equation systems using an efficient algorithm
known as "L-R-decomposition" and several approximative (iterative) methods.

Features an implementation of Kleene's algorithm to compute the minimal
costs for all paths in a graph with weighted edges (the "weights" being
the costs associated with each edge).

Allows to solve the eigensystem of a real symmetric matrix, using
Householder transformation and QL decomposition.

## Installation Instructions

Since Math::MatrixReal 2.03, Module::Build is used for the build process, but
a Makefile.PL is still generated for older installations. If you do not have
Module::Build, please read the OLD_README file.

The build and install Math::MatrixReal run the commands

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
