--------------------------
	* Steffen Beyer gave maintainer-ship to Jonathan Leto
	* exponent() function added
	* trace() function added
	* "**" and "**="  overloaded to exponent()
	* $matrix ** -1 is now a quick way to compute the inverse, if it exists
	* new_from_rows and new_from_cols integrated from Math::MatrixReal::Ext1
	* is_diagonal() function added
	* is_tridiagonal() function added
	* each() function added
	* each_diag() function added
	* put functions used by all the test scripts into funcs.pl instead
		of all of them having copy+paste code
	* t/inverse.t created 
	* t/diag.t created 
	* t/exponent.t created
	* t/trace.t created
	* t/ext1.t created
	* some documentation spelling errors corrected
	* perl operators exp(),sin(),cos() overloaded 
		only works with diagonal matrices for now

	* is_lower_triangular() function added
	* t/triang.t created
	* t/det.t created
	* inverse() function added
	* det() function added
		should be much faster for diagonal and triangular matrices
